## 🔧 MAINTENANCE

### Verify Triggers are Active
```sql
USE BankingDB;
SHOW TRIGGERS WHERE `Trigger` LIKE 'after_%';
```

**Expected Output:** 4 triggers

### Check Database Connection
```php
// In any subsystem config/database.php
// Should all connect to: BankingDB
define('DB_NAME', 'BankingDB');
```

### Monitor Integration Health
```sql
-- Check recent journal entries created by triggers
SELECT journal_no, description, created_at, reference_no
FROM journal_entries
WHERE reference_no LIKE 'BT-%'  -- Bank transactions
   OR reference_no LIKE 'LD-%'  -- Loan disbursements
   OR reference_no LIKE 'LP-%'  -- Loan payments
   OR reference_no LIKE 'PR-%'  -- Payroll
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
